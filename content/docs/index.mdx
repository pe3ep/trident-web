Trident is a clientside mod made to improve and build upon your [MCC Island](https://mccisland.net/) experience.

It's made in a way which nicely integrates with the existing server interface and feels right at home.

Trident is also fully compatible with other QoL mods made for MCCI, and it is actually recommended to use them together to have the best Island experience!

This Wiki explains each part of the mod in detail, allowing you to learn more about all features.

Trident is fully open source and actively maintained mostly by [Pe3ep](https://pe3epwithyou.cc) and [SirArchibald97](https://sirarchibald.dev). You can find mod's Github page [here](https://github.com/pe3ep/Trident).
