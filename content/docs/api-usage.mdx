Sometimes, Trident will require the use of [MCC Island's API](https://api.mccisland.net/) to get some information about the user.

Currently, only one feature requires API access: the [**Exchange Module**](/docs/modules/exchange-module).

There are two ways to access the API:

- Using **Trident Web** (default, recommended)
- Bringing your own API token

We generally recommend **Trident Web** because it requires no setup. However, using your own token gives you more control and faster responses.

## Trident Web (Recommended)

This option is enabled by default and requires no setup. Note that this is slower than using your own token and
might stop being maintained in the future.

**Responses from MCC Island's API are not collected by Trident Web.**

## Bringing Your Own Token

### Step 1: Sign In

Visit https://gateway.noxcrew.com and sign in with your Microsoft account.

### Step 2: Create an API Token

After logging in, you’ll be redirected to your profile page. Scroll down to the **Developers** section.

Click the **CREATE KEY** button. This will generate a new API token, which you can copy directly to your clipboard.

Once you’ve copied the token, continue to the next step.

### Step 3: Add the Token In-Game

With the token copied, you’ll need to add it in-game.

1. Join **MCC Island**
2. Run the following command, replacing the placeholder with your token:

```text
/trident api setToken REPLACE_THIS_WITH_TOKEN
```

Your command should look similar to this:

Double-check that everything is correct, then send the command. You should see a confirmation message. Your API provider in the config will be automatically changed to "Token"

<Callout title="Caution" type="warning">
Your token is stored as plaintext in the config file of Trident. **DO NOT SHARE your config file with anyone if you're using this option.**

If you wish to share your config, make sure you run `/trident api resetToken` to remove your token.

</Callout>
