Bringing your own API token into Trident unlocks additional features.

Currently, only one feature requires API access: the **Exchange Module**.

There are two ways to access the API:

- Using **Lighthouse** (recommended)
- Bringing your own API token

We generally recommend Lighthouse because it’s easier to set up. However, using your own token gives you more control.

## Lighthouse (Recommended)

## Bringing Your Own Token

### Step 1: Sign In

Visit https://gateway.noxcrew.com and sign in with your Microsoft account.

### Step 2: Create an API Token

After logging in, you’ll be redirected to your profile page. Scroll down to the **Developers** section.

Click the **CREATE KEY** button. This will generate a new API token, which you can copy directly to your clipboard.

Once you’ve copied the token, continue to the next step.

### Step 3: Add the Token In-Game

With the token copied, you’ll need to add it in-game.

1. Join **MCC Island**
2. Run the following command, replacing the placeholder with your token:

```text
/trident api setToken REPLACE_THIS_WITH_TOKEN
```

Your command should look similar to this:

Double-check that everything is correct, then send the command. You should see a confirmation message.
