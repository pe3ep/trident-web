title: Questing Module
---

Quests are an essential part of how you play MCC Island games. Everything in the server economy one way or another ties to them,
which is why the questing module was made.

## Overview

When joining a game you will see a small window open - that's the questing module! It shows you the following:

- Active quests for this game
- Shortened objective for each quest
- Live-updated Quest progress

## Live updates

Your progress towards the quest is tracked and sent straight from the server to Trident, updating it live!
This now includes quests such as HITW's "Dodge walls", Rocket Spleef's "Direct Hits" and the rest.

## Options

As most things in Trident, the Questing module is highly customizable to your liking.

Currently, you can make the quest objectives follow their rarity, hide the questing module in games with no quests, hide remaining quests number and more.

You can see the full up-to-date list in the configuration screen of Trident
