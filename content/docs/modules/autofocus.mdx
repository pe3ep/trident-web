title: Auto focus

This feature allows you to stop worrying about not being alt-tabbed when the game is about to start.

When the countdown is about to start, Trident will attempt to force your game on top.

It's important to note that this only works while in full screen and when using Windows.
Trident will fallback to flashing your icon in taskbar/dock if it fails to put the window on top.
