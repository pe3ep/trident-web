title: Kilfeed Module
---

One of the most loved features of Trident is the killfeed. Similiar to games like Valorant and Counter Strike 2,
it neatly shows player eliminations throughout the game.

## Streaks

The killfeed includes a nice feature – streaks! When someone gets more than one kill, you will notice a small `II` icon
next to their name.

When a player gets 4 or more kills, they will be on a **rampage**, which will be indicated by **an animated fire** on their name.

## Assists

Similar to streaks, the killfeed shows whether or not you assisted to an elimination

## Options

Killfeed is by far one of the most customizable modules of Trident. Starting from the position on the screen and how many kills are shown at once,
you can customizable it however you desire!

You can see the full up-to-date list in the configuration screen of Trident
