title: Rarity Overlay
---

This is probably one of the smallest features of Trident, but it's for sure one of the most useful!

When enabled, it displays a customizable overlay behind any MCCI item with a rarity: cosmetics, blueprints, materials, chests, fish, crabs, quests – you name it!

## Shape

There's currently 3 overlay shapes to choose from: Outline, U-shaped and Fill.

You can see the full up-to-date list in the configuration screen of Trident
