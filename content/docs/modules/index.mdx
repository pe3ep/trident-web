title: Modules
---

Trident features a lot of features that are split into their own "Modules".

This allows users to quickly toggle them. They also feature a lot of configuration options so users can configure modules to their liking.

Configuring the modules is done through the config screen which can be opened using a keybind on MCCI ( <kbd>U</kbd> by default) or by using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)
