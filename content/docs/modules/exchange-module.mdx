With the release of player trading on MCCI Island Exchange was introduced, bringing a brand new way to interact with the economy.
This module aims to improve that experience with a few QoL changes

## Best Price

When opening the Isalnd Exchange interface you will many "star" icons on the top right of some listings. This indicates that this exact listing has the best price currently available on the market.

There's a few different star colors that indicate different things:

- Gold Star: This is the best price for this **exact** listing. For example, if 2 people were selling a 5 MCC+ tokens for 4 and 3 million, it would show a gold star next to the 3 million listing, even if there's a single token available for 1000 coins. This is due to gold star treating each listing as its own, without caring about the price of an individual item inside of stacks.
- Blue Star: Best bulk price. This is the best price for a **single item** compared to all listings. This star takes into account the amount of items sold in a listing.
- Green Star: This is the only listing of this type.
