## Ownership indicator

When crafting cosmetics sometimes its hard to tell which ones are new, which ones have max donations and which ones are just duplicates.

Blueprint Indicators solves that by showing icons on brand new and maxed cosmetics.

## Crafting ability indicator

In the Blueprint Assembler UI, to easily spot when you don't have enough materials to craft a blueprint it will show a small icon in the bottom left corner of the slot.
