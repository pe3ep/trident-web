title: Depleted Display
---

Another quite small QoL addition to Trident is the Depleted Display. Most users with MCC+ fish while being alt-tabbed from the game, sometimes missing the sound when the spot deplets.

Tridents solves this by playing another louder sound and flashing your game icon in the taskbar/dock. This brings your attention, allowing you to go back back into the game and choose a new spot.
