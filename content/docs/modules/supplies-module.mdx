title: Supplies Module
---

Supplies module is one of the most useful features of Trident for fishing.
It shows your current available bait, your line durability, your equipped augments and your available overclocks.

## Overclock display

Supplies module shows your currently equipped overclocks, including your unstable and supreme ones.
Due to those only working for a limited time before being put on cooldown, its almost essential to see exactly how much time you have left on them.

When enabling a timed overclock, you will see that the timer will start immediatly in the module UI. Over time, timer will fade to yellow and red, indicating how much time you got left.
Once the timer runs out, you will see how long you have to wait until the cooldown period of the overclock passess.
Once your overclock is ready again, you will get a message in chat (You will receive this message even if you're on a different server)

## Augment display

Augment display in the Supplies module shows your active augments and other fishing consumables. Currently, it tracks whether it was repaired, needs repairing or if its broken.

When the consumable is new, it will have a **green** durability bar. When item needs repairing, you will see a wrench icon in front it.
Once the item is repaired, the progress bar turns yellow. When item is inevitebly broken, it will be crossed.
Paused augments will have a pause icon in front of them.

## Options

Due to it's minimal design, there's currently only one option for customization – augment durability number.
